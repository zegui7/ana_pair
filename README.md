# AnaPair - Understanding related protein-protein interfaces

This is a method developed to study complex protein structure with several structural bioinformatics tools.

It can work with:
 * A "family" of homologous complexes
 * A molecular dynamics trajectory
 * A protein structures ensemble (as in NMR)

It is still being slowly implemented when I have free time, but eventually it will be made available in a Shiny or Django server, depending on what looks like the best fit.
